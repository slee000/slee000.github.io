									<h2>Multi-modal Locomotion and Environmental Adaptability of Legged Robots using Soft Inflatable Sensing Skin</h2>

									<sup><b>Figure 01.</b> Concept of soft inflatable sensing skin integrated with a legged robot. (Image source: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOSOFT.2019.8722711">Prior research</a>)</sup></span></div></p>
									
									<p> I implemented the concept robot presented in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOSOFT.2019.8722711">previous research</a> as an actual robot system, and controlled robot motions and all components, including motors, sensors, and air pump, with an embedded system.</p>
									
									<p>I set up quadruped robot systems using commercial and custom-designed quadruped robots. The commercial quadruped robot included three additional subsystems (air supply system, sensing system, and an external control system).
									The air supply system and the sensing system were the same as those of the custom-built quadruped robot system with libraries (1), (2).
									The control system consisted of a leader personal computer (PC), a follower single board computer (SBC), a follower microcontroller unit (MCU), and a router.
									The leader PC received fabric-based touch sensor data and air pressure sensor data using user datagram protocol (UDP) communication (via wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi)).
									The leader PC used robot operating system (ROS) to control the commercial quadruped robot and obtained inertial measurement unit (IMU) data, body state data, and position data of motors.
									Furthermore, the PC received the operatorsâ€™ order, determined the sensor states, sent commands to the follower MCU, and saved data to the system log.
									The follower SBC collected data from fabric sensors and air pressure sensors and sent these to the leader PC.
									The follower MCU controlled the air supply system according to the commands from the leader PC.</p>

									<sup><b>Figure 02.</b> Control system of the commercial quadruped robot.</sup></span></div></p>
									
									<p>The custom-designed quadruped robot was fabricated with servo motors and 3D-printed parts to demonstrate the various uses of the inflatable skin effectively.
									The robot system was configured as an embedded system to operate robustly in a completely untethered condition without software collision between subsystems.
									The robot contains four subsystems: control system, air supply system, motor system, and sensing system.
									The control system was composed of a leader controller (SBC) and a follower controller (MCU).
									The leader controller communicated with an external PC via a router using Wi-Fi to receive main commands and transmit system states to the operator.
									Upon receiving commands, the leader controller calculated desired motor configurations and transmitted them to the servo motors.
									The leader controller also received all sensor data from fabric-based touch sensors and air pressure sensors, determined the sensor states, and saved them to the system log.
									The follower controller accepted orders of the leader controller to operate the air supply system.
									The air supply system was composed of four MOSFETs, an air pump, and three solenoid valves.
									The MOSFETs were controlled by the follower controller to regulate the air pump and solenoid valves.
									The motor system consisted of two communicators and 12 motors.
									The communicator received the motor position command and transmitted it to the motor controller to move the motor to the desired positions by using libraries (3).
									The sensing system included a total of 31 sensing units (27 sensors and four air pressure sensors) and eight analog-to-digital converters (ADCs).
									All the sensing units were connected to the ADCs, which then transmitted the digital data to the leader controller using the serial peripheral interface (SPI) protocol.</p>
